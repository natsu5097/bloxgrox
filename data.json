The reason it's better than Magma is because its ability is easier to target than moving targets like segment and limits knockback when spamming M1. However, for the head, Magma is still better.",
        "Interestingly, Dragon's icon in the shop is the only icon that goes out of the margin.",
        "Dragon is the second fruit that has two icons, the other being Control.",

        "There is a glitch where discounted Dragon appears on the recommended fruits bar.",
        "There is a glitch where if the player transforms, they are sometimes \"invisible\" to other players.",
        "Dragon was the first fruit to receive the 'in-progress' status, followed by Gravity as the second, both Barrier and Falcon as the third, Pain as the fourth, and Rumble as the fifth.",
        "Dragon (East)'s full transformation emits growling sounds, unlike the Western counterpart.",
        "As of Update 27.1, Dragons are rollable for the first time since Updates 22-23.",
        "Due to recent changes of the Dragon (especially East), Sea Beasts can drain the user's Fury Meter to negative.\nCyborg's Energy Core V3 ability can also drain Dragon (East)'s fury meter in seconds.",

Then, the user swings their arm around through the air, picking up any enemies nearby, then smashes it down from a great height, crushing enemies and launching debris, as well as launching both parties into the air. The move can only be held for 4 seconds, and the entire swing-to-smash animation lasts around 3 seconds. This is one of the best combo extenders in the game.",
        " — The user summons multiple donuts around their cursor and starts punching, and after a short while, the donuts start rapidly punching at the direction of the cursor, pummeling anyone unfortunate enough to get caught in the barrage. While the move is performed, neither the user nor the stunned enemy may move unless the move is stopped by the user, or if their move gets cancelled if the user gets damaged. The user can also change the direction at which the donuts punch, and therefore can change the position of their victims caught in their attack. This move has a duration of around 5 seconds when fully held. This move is good for opening or closing combos.",
        " — The user turns into a spiked donut that starts rolling at fast speeds. This move is great for traveling, as it can roll on both water and lava, climb walls and damage anyone that it touches while moving (unlike its unawakened version).

When transformed, the user gains a 50% defense buff with enhanced attacks.",
        "Hazardous Puddles — The user can make poisonous puddles by certain attacks (Z, X and transformed C). Every player within the radius of these puddles will be inflicted with a poisonous miasma, which deals a hefty amount of tick damage. If caused by attack [X] or [C] (Transformed), the enemy's screen will turn dark purple and wobble. The puddles also deal damage to enemies, but they will not be affected by miasma and will not be damaged if they walk out from the puddles.",
        "Venomous Drop — While transformed, Air Jumping two or more times or going up to a good height and then falling to the ground will cause a small explosion and leave poison puddles. The duration of the user's fall does not affect the spread of the puddles. This passive is similar to Mammoth's Prehistoric Leap and Awakened Buddha's Seismic Jump passive.",
        " — The user fires a barrage of poisonous blades in the direction of the cursor, stunning any enemy in the attack if multiple blades simultaneously hit the target, and leaving puddles of Venom Miasma on the ground if used close enough to it. Holding this move will make the user launch more blades. This move is similar to Dragon C, Light X (unawakened) and Magma Z.",
        " — The user gathers venom in their hands, creating a big poison ball. The user then launches three bolts of venom at the same time in the direction of the cursor, which explode and leave multiple puddles of Venom Miasma on the ground if used close enough to it. Any enemy who got hit by the explosion will be poisoned and their screen will be distorted for a short period of time. This ability has aim-assist/auto-aim.",
        " — The user produces a deadly smoke, surrounding them completely until its duration ends. The smoke will continually damage the opponent (5-6 ticks) if they stay within the proximity of the Venom user. Interestingly, once the opponent is damaged by only one tick of this move, or damaged until the smoke ends, they will still take poison damage, meaning that this move inflicts extra poison damage (3-4 ticks), which is pretty much similar to the [X] move.",
        " — The user gathers a large amount of venom and then transforms, taking the form of a giant three-headed draconic monster, resembling a hydra. This move tremendously boosts damage for all of its attacks in the moveset, and massively increases poison damage (from puddles). Additionally, all of Venom's moves gain a different color scheme. This move grants the user 50% defense against all attacks, and is immune to basic LMB attacks from NPCs (note that players could still hit the user with M1s). The user also gains a jump boost, but their dash distance and walking speed is significantly reduced. While transformed, the user cannot use any other moves and attacks besides Venom's. This move consumes 15% of the Fury Meter.",
        " — The user surrounds themselves with venom that resembles a long serpent before beginning to fly. The user's movement speed is quite slow in this form, but their speed increases as their health gets lower. Anyone who goes through the serpent will take continual poison damage. When the user stops holding the [F] key, it creates a small purple explosion, dealing AoE damage and high poison tick damage. This move lasts for 40 seconds.",
        " — The user fires a barrage of venom projectiles. This time, the user is able to shoot more projectiles, deal more damage and leave much more puddles on the ground. This move also has a larger hitbox and longer range. This move consumes 7.5% of the Fury Meter.",
        " — The user gathers a large amount of venom, creating a large sphere of poison. The user then spits out three bolts of venom at the same time in the direction of the cursor, which explode and leave multiple puddles of Venom Miasma on the ground. Any enemy who got hit by the explosion will have their screen distorted and will be poisoned, dealing four ticks of damage. This version has bigger hitbox and longer range, while also retaining it's aim assist/auto-aim feature. This move consumes 10% of the Fury Meter.",
        " — The user breathes out a massive cloud of venomous gas that surrounds the player and deals massive damage to anyone in its radius. Players who are inside the fog and are taking damage will be unable to dash, use their Air jumps and Instinct until they either go out of the fog or the fog dissipates. Each cycle deals three ticks of damage, the user can do two cycles with this skill. Once enemies take one tick of poison, they will take the next two ticks. This move consumes 15% of the Fury Meter.",
        " — The user absorbs the venom in a sphere and returns back to their human form, regaining the ability to use their Fighting Style, Sword and Gun.",
        " — The user surrounds themselves with venom that resembles a long serpent before taking to the sky. This time, the serpent is much larger, and moves much faster based on how much damage the user has taken in total. Three smaller dragon heads spin around the serpent. Once the user hits a target or stops pressing F, the serpent explodes, dealing damage and leaving a poison puddle if near the ground. The three heads will also be released, homing in on any nearby targets and dealing more damage. Unlike the untransformed version of this move, moving into the enemy while using this move does not affect them with the poisonous effect. This move lasts for 10 seconds. This move consumes 5% of the Fury Meter.\nNote: Only one target per head, if there’s only one enemy near, one head will target them, and the other two will despawn after they hit the ground.",
